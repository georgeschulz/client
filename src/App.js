    ["Got it. And what's the square footage of your property? This will help us determine the best treatment plan for you."],
    ["Thanks for the info! What type of property is it? (single family, townhome, apartment, condo, commercial, etc.)"],
    ["Thanks! Just to clarify, you have an apartment with 2500 sq ft and 1 acre land? Or is this the entire building size and area?"],
    ["No problem! So it's a townhome with 2500 sq ft and 1 acre. Now, have you noticed any other pests besides roaches that we should be aware of?"],
    ["Well don't fret John. We see this kind of thing all the time. Give me just a second to check some pricing for you!",
      "Okay, John, based on the information you've provided me, I would recommend our Monthly Pest and Rodent Control program. The initial price is $149, and the recurring price is only $95.0 per month. It's an ongoing pest and rodent control plan that will provide you with a high level of protection against pests, mice, and rats. We come out monthly and complete a perimeter treatment and set up and maintain a rodent baiting program. This plan covers a wide range of pests, including ants, spiders, rodent issues, millipedes, roach issues, crickets, and centipedes.",
      "This plan is best for customers with an active roach or rodent issue, like the one you described. Also, since you live in a townhome and your infestation is located in the kitchen, this could make it more difficult to control the infestation. The Monthly Pest and Rodent Control plan will provide the high level of care needed to treat the issue effectively.",
      "With this plan, you'll have year-round protection and peace of mind from seasonal invaders. The perimeter treatments keep pests from getting into your home, and we even knock down ugly cobwebs for you. You'll also get rid of severe rodent issues and keep them from coming back. The recurring price is very affordable at only $95.0 per month.",
      "John, I would love to set you up with this plan. How does it sound to you?"],
    ["We don't offer a one-time treatment for pests like roaches, mainly because these critters can be quite persistent and may require regular treatments to ensure they're entirely eliminated. Our Monthly Pest and Rodent Control program will help to maintain consistent protection and tackle any potential issues before they grow bigger. Plus, you always have the option to cancel the plan at any time if you're not satisfied. In fact, if you sign up now, I can throw in a free annual termite inspection as a bonus. How does that sound? üòä"],
    ["I totally get that, John. To help you out, I can go ahead and bump $25 off the initial price, making it just $124 for the first month! Afterward, the recurring price will be the regular $95.00 per month. And you'll still get that free annual termite inspection as a bonus. What do you think? Is that a better fit for your budget?"],
    ["I totally understand, John. It's always good to discuss things with your partner. While you're talking it over, I'll do you one better and make a special offer üéÅ. If you decide to book your visit today, I'll bump the initial price down to $99. That's a whole $50 off just for you! Remember, this plan comes with great coverage for pests and rodents, including those pesky roaches, and it includes that free annual termite inspection too."],
    ["When you're ready to move forward, let me know which date would be best for you: 4-5-23, 4-7-23, or 4-8-23. And don't hesitate to reach out if you need more information or have any questions!"],
    ["Haha, thanks John! I'm just trying to make sure you get the best possible deal üòâ. So, which date works best for you to start our Monthly Pest and Rodent Control program: 4-5-23, 4-7-23, or 4-8-23? Once we've got that sorted, I'll send you the registration link."],
    ["Awesome! You're all set for 4-7-23. To complete the registration process, just click this link: <register: ID:2, Initial: 150, Recurring: 75>. I know you and your wife will be relieved once those roaches are gone. If you have any questions or need anything at all, don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day, John! üòä"]
